You have two options to manage the source code for this module: AWS CodeCommit (included in the AWS Free Tier) or GitHub. In this tutorial, we will use CodeCommit to store our application code, but you can do the same by creating a repository on GitHub.

If you have never configured AWS CLI on your local machine, open a terminal window to install AWS CLI. The installation instructions vary depending on what operating system you're using. If you already have AWS CLI installed and configured, skip to Step 2.
Open the AWS CodeCommit console.
Choose Create Repository.
Enter wildrydes-site for the Repository name.
Choose Create.
Once repository is created, set up an IAM user with Git credentials in the IAM console. Follow the instructions for Step 1 through Step 3 on the Setup for HTTPS users using Git credentials page of the AWS CodeCommit User Guide. 
Important Note: When setting up your user in the IAM console, you will need to set up and save two sets of credentials to refer back to.
You must create Access keys in the IAM > Security Credentials tab. Download the Access Key and Secret Access Key IDs or copy and save them in a secure location.
You must also generate HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit. Download or save these generated credentials as well.
In the terminal window you used to install AWS CLI, enter the command: aws configure
Enter the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key you created in Step 6. 
For Default region name enter the Region you initially selected to create your CodeCommit repository in.
Leave Default output format blank, and press enter.
